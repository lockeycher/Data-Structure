<h1>CSC 403/Data Structures II<br />Take home final exam</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Setup and submission</h2>
<p>
Place written answers into a text, Word, or PDF document with the name <code>finalexam</code> followed by the appropriate extension.  Place all Java code into an Eclipse package called <code>finalexam</code>.  Zip the package into a file called <code>finalexam.zip</code> and submit that single file.  Everything means:
<ol>
<li>the package folder <code>finalexam</code>
<li>the document <code>finalexam.{txt,doc,docx,pdf}</code> with the written answers
<li><code>HashTable.java</code>
<li><code>DFSTrace.java</code>
<li><code>BFSTrace.java</code>
</ol>
I have the test programs so please do not include those.
</p>
<h2>Written answers</h2>
<p>
1. (5 points) Draw the binary search tree that results after  inserting all of the following values: 15, 20, 25, 30, 5, 8, 10, 2, 16.
</p>
<p>
2. (5 points) Draw the 2-3 tree that results after inserting all of the following values: 15, 20, 25, 30, 5, 8, 10, 2, 16.
</p>
<p>
3. (5 points) Draw the left-leaning red-black tree that corresponds to the 2-3 tree drawn in the previous exercise.  Please clearly mark which edges are red and which are black.
</p>
<p>
4. (5 points) Draw the AVL tree that results after inserting all of the following values: 15, 20, 25, 30, 5, 8, 10, 2, 16.  </p>
<p>
5. (10 points) Given an instance of a <code>LinearProbingHashST</code> from the <code>algs34</code> package where the key type is String and where the length of the table is set at 31, list the indices and contents in the <code>keys</code> array once the following strings have been inserted in this order:
<ul>
<li>"hello"
<li>"hEllo"
<li>"heLlo"
<li>"helLo"
<li>"HellO"
<li>"hELLO"
<li>"HeLLO"
<li>"HElLO"
<li>"HELlO"
<li>"hELLo"
</ul>
Please provide written answers of the form:
<pre>
"hello": index
"hEllo": index
"heLlo": index
"helLo": index
"HellO": index
"hELLO": index
"HeLLO": index
"HElLO": index
"HELlO": index
"hELLo": index
Number of collisions: value
</pre>
You may certainly write code to help you but I just want the written answers.
</p>
<h2>Programming problems</h2>
<p>
6. (10 points) The class <code>HashTable</code> is an implementation of a hash table.  Add a method called <code>keys</code> that returns an Iterable object with the keys in the hash table sorted in ascending order.  You may test it with the program <code>TestHashTable</code>. Both are found in <a href="HashTableCode.zip">HashTableCode.zip</a>.
</p>
7. (10 points) Write a program <code>DFSTrace</code> that contains a version of a depth first search that prints a trace of its traversal.  Write a public static method:
<pre>
public static void dfsPrintTrace(Graph g) {
    // *** Declare and initialize the marked array.
    dfsPrintTrace(g, 0, marked, 0);
}
</pre>
This method calls a private method:
<pre>
private static void dfsPrintTrace(Graph g, int start, boolean[] marked, int indent)
</pre>
All references to a method below refer to this second method.  Every message printed should be preceded by the number of spaces specified by the <code>indent</code> parameter.  A recursive call should pass an indent value with 1 added.
<ul>
<li>The first time the method visits a vertex, it should print the message "First time at vertex n", where n is the integer label of the vertex.
<li>Every other time it visits a vertex, it should print the message "Visiting vertex n again".
<li>When it exits, it should print the message "Finished searching from n".
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Here's the output when run on the file <code>data/tinyG.txt</code>:
<pre>
First visit to 0.
 First visit to 6.
  Visited 0 again.
  First visit to 4.
   First visit to 5.
    First visit to 3.
     Visited 5 again.
     Visited 4 again.
    Finished with 3.
    Visited 4 again.
    Visited 0 again.
   Finished with 5.
   Visited 6 again.
   Visited 3 again.
  Finished with 4.
 Finished with 6.
 First visit to 2.
  Visited 0 again.
 Finished with 2.
 First visit to 1.
  Visited 0 again.
 Finished with 1.
 Visited 5 again.
Finished with 0.
</pre>
<p>
<p>
Here's the main method to insert into your program to test your method(s):
<pre>
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		In input = new In("data/tinyG.txt");
		Graph g = new Graph(input);

		dfsPrintTrace(g);
	}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Include in the comments of your code the answer to this question: What is the pattern formed by the "First visit" and "Finished" messages?</strong>
</p>
<p>
8. (10 points) Write a program <code>BFSTrace</code> that contains a version of a breadth first search that prints a trace.  Write a public method with the signature:
<pre>
public static void bfsPrintTrace(Graph g)
</pre>
Recall that a breadth first search uses a queue to organize visiting vertices.  Print the messages "Enqueueing n" and "Dequeueing n" at the appropriate places.
</p>
<p>
Here's the output when run on the file <code>data/tinyG.txt</code>:
<pre>
Enqueued 0.
Dequeued 0.
Enqueued 6.
Enqueued 2.
Enqueued 1.
Enqueued 5.
Dequeued 6.
Enqueued 4.
Dequeued 2.
Dequeued 1.
Dequeued 5.
Enqueued 3.
Dequeued 4.
Dequeued 3.
</pre>
<p>
Here's the main method to insert into your program to test your method(s):
<pre>
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		In input = new In("data/tinyG.txt");
		Graph g = new Graph(input);

		bfsPrintTrace(g);
	}
</pre>
